Help the homeless children
Help them to survive a World they canât understand

God help the child whoâs needy
Who deserves not pity
Help them to survive this cold and bitter land

Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I wonât cry about it, I wonât cry about it

Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is the Ville, home of the fast-lifers
Where we get high and donât come down, we gas righteous
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was
Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars
I ainât crying tho..
Then save that pity for the next man
Or that girl getting beat down by her ex-man
Hey, hold your head, mama
I know you wish that nigga dead, mama
If I can find a way to kill him, I wonât have any drama
Damn mama, tell me who you love
This one is for the boy that sees his mama on drugs
I feel your pain, boy and just know that I been through the same, boy
That lady needs you more than ever
Donât be ashamed boy
Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella
And now she in the bedroom on her knees
Staring at the sky, screaming âLord please!â
Tell me now

[Verse 2]
Soon as you cling on, my mindâs saying âbe gone!â
I leave em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons
Confused, cause friendshipâs abuse and Iâm sorry for it
My life performance been trifling, some nights I fight my conscience?
Was never given space, but I always heared the heart
Always miss playing the hand that was dealt the joker cards
Itâs what I was feeling like, lonely low energy
Fallin slow clinically, ballinâ over we finna be
Donât pity me ever, even when them haters answering
Mindstate of the victim, no victim, Iâm just a champion
Money come in slow, God, intervene
Spiritâs never broken, Iâm just focused, donât pity me
No no no, you see this pain put a strain on my whole life
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights
But all I ask is donât pity me, no, no!
Donât pity me, no, no, no!

I canât cry about it
Nah, nah, be strong
Canât cry about it
Hey

[Verse 3]
I freestyle life, can barely write the rent
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check
Call up mama, hate to borrow money, with Christmas near
Hey you know what? How about we make each other gifts this year
Friends are calling me up, asking me if Iâm signed yet
Who Iâm working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?
Disappointment within their voices, do they pity me?
Disbelief, Iâma stay driven like them city streets
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather
Can barely fit my pain and poverty the same umbrella
But he donât care, he donât care, itâs hard to keep em dry
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom
This lifeâll flash before your eyes
So get your match before your fire turns to ash
No more drive, no more gas, before you cry, get your last
Before you die, life your past with no regrets
Broken X, no looking back man
