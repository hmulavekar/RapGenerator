[J. Cole]
One time for the Plan
straight to the top
I got the power in my hands
yeah, live for the moment be high
act like you wanna reach high
know we aint on but we try
now holla back and reply

[Verse 1]
I feel like I live for this moment
see it in their eyes the other guys donât want it
my style they can crown but canât dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I-I-Iâm on it
what a powerful performance
I was in my zone send flowers for opponents
tell em get well soon cause I aint in the mood
so if you read that word backwards it should spell doom
Iâm on fire yâall can inhale fumes
as I zoom by ya as ya thinking whoâs higher
fueled by a desire you should admire
thatâs why Iâm what they aspire to be before they retire
a livinâ legend with God given blessings
and game so cold they probably watching this in heaven
expectinâ the incredible so baby what me do that
and make the angels say Lord how he do that

[J. Cole]
One time for the Plan
straight to the top
I got the power in my hands
yeah, live for the moment be high
act like you wanna reach high
know we aint on but we try
now holla back and reply
(la la la la la la)

[Verse 2]
A champions mentality
and so Iâm scoring ignoring the fact you fouling me
And 1 where I go you canât come
I was schooling your father boy that make you my grandson
uh, I been around the block twice though my shot nice
no referee but best believe out here I got stripes
now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
would u believe I started off as a benchwarmer
had me feeling like master splinter
now the heads and commentators say thats a winner
hey, hard work pay off nah i dont take a day off,
I rest not i guess thats why ur best short way off
these are the things that dreams are made of
itâs sweet, no time for sleep when youâre elite
if what you reap is what you sow then wat was u expecting
expect to come in secound while I become a legend

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
why dont you reach for the sky
ooh, you dont believe you could fly
I guess I see you when you get in, I guess I see you when you get in
(la la la la la la)

[Chorus]
