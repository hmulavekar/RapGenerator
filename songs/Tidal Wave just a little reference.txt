Huh, can we vibe just a little?
That would be a dream come true
Ain't gon' lie, just like a fiend I've been feelin' you
Just a little, just a little

Um, uh
Had to let it ride just a little
Let me bring it back so it's clear
I've been wantin' you since we were little
Now we're full grown and you here
Do you have time just a little?
I can make it worth your while
Ain't you diggin' me a little?
Damn you look good when you smile

Huh
Just a little
Don't let mine ever change
Don't ever change, don't ever change
