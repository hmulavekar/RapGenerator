Ayo Scoob, ayo Scoob
My nigga, what's good? Word
Yessir, what's poppin'?
I'm comin' through, hold up, hold up
Stay right there, I'm comin' through, hol' up (Bvtman)
Hell yeah, can't believe I seen this nigga Scoob, man
It's crazy

Uh, don't you dare run from it
There's no bogeyman, it ain't comin' to hurt you
I think acceptance is somewhat of a virtue
To look your truth dead in the face
Without tryna escape the regret or disgrace
I write these words aimlessly
But not without hope
That somehow I'll stumble on somethin' that's dope
A clever lil' line, a thought to provoke
Myself and that listener diggin' for quotes, hello
I don't even know if somebody gon' hear this
Got so many songs that get lost in the endless (Bvtman)
Folders of the hard drive, I wish I was more fearless
'Cause I'll just say, "Fuck it" and dump all the music
For niggas that hate it and niggas that use it
As fuel to push them through long nights at school
Writin' that last minute paper for class
That's due in the mornin'
And I still relate to that procrastination for tasks
'Cause I need to finish this album
But hell, how many more times
Can I send this wooden pail down in that well
And pull it back up with the hope that it's filled?
Plus, it don't help that I'm rich now
So that means that I don't gotta deal
With stress of these creditors, callin' my cellular
Like that young rapper that don't got a deal (Bvtman)
But do got the skill and do got the will
To make it no matter how long that it takes
For labels to see you or a song that'll break
And the rest of the world to catch on that he's great
Uh, how do you tap into hunger
When you don't got wonder
'Bout when your next meal is comin' from?
Maybe you feel my conundrum
Or maybe the real is I'm so, um
Far removed from the struggles of everyday folks
My shit just ain't never gon' hit like it hit
When a nigga was a lil' more closer to broke (Broke)
Uh, but fuck it, the challenge be havin' me stoked
Throw in the towel? Man, you gotta be jokin'
I push my salary up with these quotes (Bvtman)
Now, I push the Lambo' truck down in the 'Ville
Hopin' I connect with somethin' that's real
Part of me wonders why I'm even still (Still)
Uh, holdin' on to this place
My momma been gone and my partners is straight, right?
Right

(Bvtman)
