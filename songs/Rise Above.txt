Rise above, rise aboveâ¦
And youâve got toâ¦
Rise above, rise aboveâ¦

[Verse 1]
She had her little daughter with her, it was cold out
Said âah, I hate this motherfucker,â then she rolled out
He ainât answering his phone, she yells âwhat the fuck?!â
Then told her daughter âbuckle up, yeah, thatâs for safetyâ
See she been stressinâ lately
âCause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he donât text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he donât sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he donât call back, all he say is âfall backâ
Nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
She just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he been creepinâ, he been fuckinâ with Yolanda
âYolanda?"
"Yeah girl, Yolanda. Told you he ainât shit but you ainât listen, I was trynaâ â
[Click] â hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
âThought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shitâ
âPickinâ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fightsâ
âAnd long nights, for what? These niggas is all alikeâ
She gonâ set it off, her daughter gonâ witness it all tonight, damnâ¦

[Verse 2]
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they donât listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
Iâm fuckinâ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Lilâ niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they donât even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
âCause he look just like her brother, she be havinâ to call his mother
But she act like she donât care â what father? He ainât here
Now she frustrated, thinkinâ that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havinâ to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkinâ, tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
âCause ainât no hope for the youth, well ainât that the truth
When all your role models either rappinâ or they hoop, damnâ¦
