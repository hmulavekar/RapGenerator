[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirlsâll clown like
âGirl I ain't know you like âem bitesizeâ
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think Iâm no good for âem
Too dark, too thick, too hood for âem
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what Iâm doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about a 5 year plan
She saying âwho Iâm foolinâ, they could never understandâ
They could never understand

Look at me
I Just canât believe
What theyâve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just canât believe
What theyâve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still Iâm wathcing CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep âem niggas walking blind all the time
But the same niggas think Iâm fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
Iâd rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day youâll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out, that old sound that Iâve grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it donât matter Iâm on Saturn now and I wonât shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow Iâm gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel
My flowâs thorough, now Iâm more aware of the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake
That's why I call the shit a race
Tha gony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus]
Look at me
I Just canât believe
What theyâve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just canât believe
What theyâve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Weâre all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
Weâre all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
Weâre all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me
