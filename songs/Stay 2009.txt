[Verse 1]
You can drop a âWet Floorâ sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
Iâm tryna figure if I should even appear, or
Should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right â catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them maâfuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know theyâll lock me if I stay
Butâ¦ where Iâmma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ainât see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayinâ âstay with meâ
Aw, girl, you bad as Hell
And yet Iâd love to â
But see I got a girl Iâm really makinâ love to
Therefore Iâm feelinâ a lot more guilty when I rub you
Thatâs why I skip all of that kissinâ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you canât have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stayâ¦

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown, âfore I could take a step
Iâm gettinâ grown now
And startinâ to notice that I see the same hoes 'round
Guess they had to go âround, my raps is profound
I got the flows but yet a nigga ainât got no sound
Copped a beat machine, Iâm cookinâ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if Iâmma get to where Iâm goinâ then I canât stay
Although I love it here
Iâll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreaminâ dreams, hopinâ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavinâ is to know my motherâs here
Oh, but Iâm cominâ back â oh boy, believe that
Letâs show the lilâ niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and Iâm here to stayâ¦

[Hook]
