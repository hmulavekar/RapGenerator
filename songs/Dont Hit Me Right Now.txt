Yeah
Ayy
Big for now
It's a check
I got the chopper, yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

I got the chopper, it sing like opera, I make it swoon the bitch
They know my name, when I'm swerving lanes they still ask who that is
She on the molly at the house party, hope she don't play the kid
Can't hit my phone, I'm on airplane mode, I'm still on two percent
Don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, yeah
Don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, no
Don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, yeah
Don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, don't hit me right now, bitch (It's a check)

[Bas:]
I ain't opposed
She threw the pussy and I ain't opposed
Fighting the lows
Smoking this shit 'til my eyelids are closed
I wear the sheepskin but I am the wolf
I am the poster-child
Finessing the lion that's posing in clothing and lying
To open it, hope that these niggas'll try him
I smoke 'em, I smoke 'em, I

[Yung Baby Tate:]
I fry 'em, I sizzle 'em
They bitin', they nibblin'
They lyin', they fibbin' it
They childish, they children
They quiet, they whispering
They dying, I'm killin' 'em
They dry, I'm drippin' in
They crying, I'm teachin', man

[Buddy:]
Man, let me call you back
I'm doin' somethin' important
Tryna get these racks
New day, new flight that I'm boarding
All of my bitches important
I seen you call, I ignored it
I got ten toes on the pavement
But my mind is in orbit, gorgeous

[Cozz:]
I say a prayer to bless mine
This ain't a quiz, don't test mine
I ain't been Wiz, but I get high
You ain't a man 'til you get by, yeah
I ain't trippin' off of nothin', you know I'ma get it, yeah
I ain't trippin' off of nothin', you know that I'm winnin'
