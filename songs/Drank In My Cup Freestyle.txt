[Verse 1]
Easy or hard way
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser hardly I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jayâs lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC ANT where I found that TNA
Ainât seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasnât nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They was waitinâ on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappinâ in diapers
To rappinâ in cyphers
To doing more numbers
Then all them fuckinâ lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you âbout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Your smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right here is mean time
In between time

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that donât really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ainât trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ainât tryinâ to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And donât tell âem nothing baby, you know that Iâm cominâ baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko Bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows whatâs up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippinâ, she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitinâ, hips right
She left her man for that get right
Iâm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokinâ baby, Iâm pimp tight
Iâm used to beinâ that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that donât really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ainât trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ainât tryinâ to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And donât tell âem nothing baby, you know that Iâm cominâ baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, âchea
