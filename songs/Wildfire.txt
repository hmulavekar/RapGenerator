Yeah
Oh, nah, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Yeah

Uh, Wassup
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money you can never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance
Girl I already tried with a lot of these niggas
Fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient's when I make a world premier
Aw, Damn, Word
Award shows coming?
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make the shit into a song
You ain't living that boy, stop stealing that light
Anything can happen when I do see y'all, guess it all depends how I'm feeling that night
Okay
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ahh
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love em all, I just love me more

[Yukimi Nagano (Little Dragon):]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rush in the night like a shock, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to -
Set the alarm cause those thrills that run up my back
You're my star nothing else can lead me off track


Hey-yeaahh....
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising hot
Your innocence -
Who's the brave?
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You'll expire
By the throat
