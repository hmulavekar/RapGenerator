[Verse 1: Special]
Never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a,
Son to his mother or a sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and donât even speak, but know itâs love though
Could never let emâ dirty your name I got the utmost respect for you,
Came back home and had to check for you,
Word 'round town is you locked down
Some older niggas snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be, she like âif you was me you wouldnât wait for me
Living fast you wouldnât mash the brakes for meâ
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook]
Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Lemme holla at you,
Yeah I know its been a while, but ainât no better time than now
Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know its been a while, but

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me,
The day you played my momma you played me
Canât believe I let you in my heart nigga
I shouldâve, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ainât want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops
Put me on to âPac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who wouldâve thought youâd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga âwhy you lie?â
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man,
But I still I feel I wonât be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppin's
Heard you trynaâ talk to, tell that punk donât call me
You ainât shit and Iâm scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit I hope it ainât true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ainât you
Cause you ainât lookinâ like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you donât know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, so you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla'ed but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White teeâs in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now itâs a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasinâ hoes like the old days,
But now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seat
Yo my nigga can I holla at you?
