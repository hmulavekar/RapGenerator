Iâm for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?
Iâm glowing, knowing that the flow intact,
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first mil Iâm blowing that
Now, like fuck it I know Iâll grow it back, shit, itâs nothing,
Funny how blacks spend their money on mad shit for stuntin
But shit, thatâs all we know man, thats how a niggas raised
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid
And you should be gettin laid by the time you in ninth grade,
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea.
In class dreamin bout having these nice things
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin
But them whites ainât
I brush it off like, âfuck it, itâs motivation,â
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take âem
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan,
But fuck it man, I ainât hatin, I gotta go for mines.
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime,
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Fortunes,
Iâm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, Iâm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I wonât pay âem attention,
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition,
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition,
While these fake niggas ainât into doing, they into wishin,

Til Iâm rich, ainât no reason to settle nigga,
It's greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese,
You niggas couldnât think at my level, even with trees,
You couldnât get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please,
Iâm chasing Gâs tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze,
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves.
Ease to the top and Iâm not finna leave til Iâm hot,
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga,
Boy, Iâm shining without the diamonds in my mouth,
Out grindin while you reclining on your couch,
Iâm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt,
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo mouth,
And you gonna find what Iâm about, nigga
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ainât gonna parlÃ© with yâall,
Iâll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher,
but check, them checks is all a nigga thinking,
For them Presidents, Iâll treat a nigga like Lincoln
