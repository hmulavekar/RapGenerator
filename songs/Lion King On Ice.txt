I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
I got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
I got a whole lot to prove

Uh, sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live but we not on the 'Gram
It's the land of supply and demand
All my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppas, won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my nigga look just like home wreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God it'll jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer, regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at a stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they don't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move momma from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes, you hang up at your locker
Gotta get rich 'cause my granny pick cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if nothin', I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Nigga dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, "Why you bother?"
We shoulda caught him and mobbed him
I said, "We gotta move smarter"
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit but they made their attempts
May have a good year like their name on a blimp
But you know what it take to be poppin' this long
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns, bring a price
Young Simba had a buss down, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me, every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
I got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
I got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie

Uh, lately, I reflect, on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before, just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, "If only I could be"
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I pray for better days
Then found the better me, I got my head on straight

Up, up and away
Just ridin' my wave, I ain't ever gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names
But never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin'
I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check
I'm never gon' say nothin', know that it's destin-
