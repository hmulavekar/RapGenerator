[Verse 1]
Yea, Iâm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left yâall browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here search for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say its an arousing point of view
Donât make me act a fool like Malcom before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth?
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shared truths
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kelidescope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ainât make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if Iâm blowing cake, blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell Iâm living, right?
Never said Iâm living right

Boy you a fool [x3]
And they like [x3]
Boy you a fool, Boy you a fool
And they like, And they like

[Verse 2]
Iâm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt left me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
First to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but Iâm sad to say that
I ainât learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
Iâm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts I donât bruise, so fuck yâall reviews
She told me Cole I love you roll with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitch and calling brothas niggas
Pardon if I cross a line but all this time
Knew you was different than all them other niggas
I responded to her âplease donât put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and Iâm still a foolâ

[Hook]
