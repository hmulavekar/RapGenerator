You know I stick to the script
Twenty-million dollar nigga, but I do it like this

(M-M-M-Maybach Music, Maybach Music)

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Wuh!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Wuh!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap
The Rolls-Royce, itâs all white
Foamposites, the LeBrons, Iâm fuckinâ witâ the Spikes

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce, itâs all white (How can I not talk big? I got to)
Foamposites (Wale!), the LeBrons, Iâm fuckinâ witâ the Spikes
Wale

[Wale - Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Ferrari mics, bitch, Iâm on my car show
My chick black and white, she ainât no dime, that bitch a Concorde
11 know Iâm reppinâ this, shoot and I donât ever miss
The coupe Iâm in is rented, I ainât witâ all that commitment shit
P-R-Ps is proper, couple Gs when Iâm shoppinâ
My girls and my SBs, got a thing for pink boxes
Shout out Frankie the Butcher, shout out Mishka in Brooklyn
Thatâs some nigga from 10.deep ATL, Iâm witâ the cooker
I ainât eâen tryinâ, fool, ho, I ball like private school
You bammas like Hyperstrikes, your wifey sleep outside of you
And Titoâs my niggas, you know just we just need more shit and
Itâs ironic how I drop some dough when I got them Homer Simpsons, look
Pine-green Foams, they may never see the store
Got LeBron Entourages like Maverick and Richie Paul
Bitch, I ball, ho, you lame, look at my Laneys, switchinâ lanes
Look at my 9s, look at my Blazers, look at my 4s, cut witâ laser
Look at my whore, that is your lady, look at my floâ, makinâ yâall crazy
Makinâ yâall sick, yâall cannot tame me, Lexus drive me, Maybach pay me
Salute

[Meek Mill]
Yo
I said Iâm swagginâ out in my Cool Greys, no LL, but these cool Js
And my wrist froze, but Iâm cool shaâ, like a bald head, Iâm too paid
Iâm too blazed, and Iâm too high, George Kush, the whole crew high
Wrong move and that tool fly, better Kon that ass like Wu-sai
Itâs MMG, MOB, young nigga, I been OG
Walk around witâ like 10 on me, that 5-7, that fenâ on me
Donât grin on me witâ them long stares, you ainât God unless no fear
Big money, all the hoes, HD, I came so clear
We jeweled out and we racked up, Phantom big when it back up
Big Boy, look like a Mack truck, shooters ride witâ that Mac tucked
Iâm a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff, Simpson-Rodgers, my last cup
On this shit, I canât stand up, country Ks as I man up
This Rozay, Wale, Gunplay, and that nigga Pill
In Brazil, and this shit is real, got bad hoes and that whippet pill
One week and we get the deal, one day and I fucked the bitch
My Levis, they 501, my snapback is hella bent

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce (Huh!), itâs all white (Huh!)
Foamposites, the LeBrons, Iâm fuckinâ witâ the Spikes

[J. Cole]
Fresh-ass nigga, no wonder why them hoes be open
Thatâs that nigga, so whatâd I say? They okey-dokinâ
How you figga? You fuckinâ witâ me? I hope he jokinâ
Iâm witcha girl, you home alone, bitch you Macauley Culkin
Iâm oviedosinâ, ay, homie, Kobe smokinâ
Then put my ashes on you niggas, bet you gonâ need lotion
Iâm slowly roastinâ, heatinâ up, so you know we toastinâ
Fuck hoes witâ no emotion, fade away like Kobe postinâ
Out in Sweden, like ainât shit that you canât tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
âCause uh, they had them Js, and my mama wouldnât cop âem
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches wannât a option
Now we livinâ much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about âem forever
My kicks like my chick, I donât need to know the numbers
You just need to know Iâm cominâ, Iâll kill you niggas this summer
