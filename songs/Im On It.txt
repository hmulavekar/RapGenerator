[Chorus:]
Lord Iâve been dreaming about the paper
I want it all
I wanna shine, I wanna ball
I want the whip with the suicide doors
this is my life homie, you decide yours
Iâve been dreaming about the paper
I want it all
I wanna shine, I wanna ball
I want the whip with the suicide doors
this is my life homie, you decide yours

Man, man Iâm on it, Iâm on it
get on my level Iâm hot like, Iâve been dancing with the devil man
Iâm on it, uh uh Iâm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe

Iâm bringing that fire, you know that flame throw
Iâm getting you high, I spittinâ that brown sugar that DeAnglo
just look in the sky
a nigga so fly Iâm up here touching rainbowâs
aint making it rain though
no donât be silly mama, Iâm no pinata
letting my paper fall, no way
but if you feeling it, you can take it all and show me
donât fight the feeling mama
not Jeffrey Dahmer but your body is a killer mama
Iâm tryna rock that ass to sleep like pyjamas

Iâma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
my palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
haters wish they could, bitch, Iâm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause...

Man, man Iâm on it, Iâm on it
get on my level Iâm hot like, Iâve been dancing with the devil man
Iâm on it, uh uh Iâm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe

And Iâm back with that flame, I got that flow thatâll blow your brain
they calling me Cole yeah thats my name
and just like Martin I know that pain
no novacaine and wont complain never
but spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather
now hey badder Iâm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or rather Lebron james
rather so much better than these featherweight rappers Iâm ahead of my time
and never pressing rewind
now watch me shine,

Iâma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
my palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
haters wish they could, bitch, Iâm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause...

Man, man Iâm on it, Iâm on it
get on my level Iâm hot like, Iâve been dancing with the devil man
Iâm on it, uh uh Iâm on it
