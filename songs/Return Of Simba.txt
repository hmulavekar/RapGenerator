Girl, you gonâ make me late undressinâ me
Know you ainât seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
âCause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, âIs you ready for it?â
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, âNigga, you already know itâ

Bitch, Iâm the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch (Yeah)
Bitch, Iâm the man of the year

What you âsposed to do when the OG niggas donât get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they wonât quit it
Homie, itâs a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that donât got a fuckinâ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jewelerâs still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makinâ a killinâ off me
Red diamonds he designinâ got me shininâ
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blindinâ
A cop light runner, they wanna but canât find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was livinâ, said âI gotta get my weight upâ
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed witâ my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, âLook, my niggas, we got a foot inâ
Beinâ good is good, thatâll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footinâ
Canât guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, youâll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my â90s niggas is gonâ get it
18 and under, thatâs prolly gonâ take a minute
Iâma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
Iâma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, five years âtil I know thirty
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, âcause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doinâ jumpinâ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runninâ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckinâ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, âcause no father figure
Means you donât got a nigga cominâ âround to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringinâ home these rotten niggas
Blowinâ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak foâ
To give the young niggas somethinâ they could reach foâ
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but Iâm a liâl more realer
When it come from the heart, donât it feel moâ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, Iâm a liâl gorilla
So pardon me, man, yâall gonâ have to pardon me
They say I rep that âVille too much, but that shit just a part of me
Itâs flowinâ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, Iâm varsity
No field trip, ainât hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie witâ yoâ bitch in it, and listen it, was starrinâ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish Iâd fail
Itâs Judgment Day, Iâm here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
Witâ dessert to take, witâ dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckinâ over
Itâs like Iâm fuckinâ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, Iâm ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadinâ my prime
âCause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds..)
