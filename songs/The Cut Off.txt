I know heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
I know heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Yeah

Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[J Cole:]
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place the value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
I know heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down, yeah

Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Give me drank, give me smoke
Get me high, let me smoke
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, jammin' out
Give me drank, give me coke
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
