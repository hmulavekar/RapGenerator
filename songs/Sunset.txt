Pyrex whipper
Niggas want smoke, mmh
Niggas want smoke, I want it too, mmh
Niggas want, mmh, niggas want, mmh
CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
265, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slipping, send him to Raleigh
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past
This shit's ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff
Quick Stop, never seen this much gas, nigga
I got a story to tell you to speak for the niggas that never could speak for theyself
I was off Cumberland Road when a couple of niggas mistook me for somebody else
I put the pedal to metal when I seen the muzzle, I couldn't help but think to myself
Boy, keep your ass in the house, the city is bad for your health

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
265, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slipping, send him to Raleigh
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

[Young Nudy:]
(Y'all really with the shit)
Pull up on your block, ain't no hesitation
Hit you with the stick, try to run, you ain't gon' make it
Whole lot of money on your head, gotta take it
Roll through your hood like some dice, we gon' shake it
Bitch turned up in the spot booty shakin', yeah (Nasty)
I like this bitch gettin' naked, yeah (Yeah, bitch)
Fuck for the money, she crazy, huh (Yeah, bitch)
Paradise East, from the bricks, yeah, they made me
Nigga wanna hate, gettin' money, say I'm crazy (Okay)
Shit bankroll, ain't nothin' but big faces
Spread it in your face, make a motherfucker hate me
Whole lot of money, make me wanna come take it
I'm in the hood where this shit ain't safe
It's okay, got a Glock, AK
Niggas try to play, I'ma hit 'em in the face
