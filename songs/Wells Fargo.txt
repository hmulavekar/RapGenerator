[Buddy & JID:]
Excuse me, sir (Yes)
Your Grace
Is that my flamethrower beside you? (Why it is)
Please, sir, pass it this way
Can you hand me that pistol over there?
Please don't get in my way
My Lord, my Lord (Yes)
Please hand me the bazooka (Why, thank you)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
No blood on the couch, please
Please, no blood on the couch (Yes)
Sir, you got blood on the couch
Can you hand me that machine gun?
Sir, damn you, yeah

Get my gun, we 'bout to rob a Wells Fargo
Got some broads, we need to get a whole carload
With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos

[Buddy:]
Father God in heaven above
I come to you as humbly as I know how
Off hella the drugs and I'm out of my mind
In the meantime, I'ma just smoke this loud
Put this shit on my tongue and this shit'll dissolve
Get a shot of Hennessy just to wash it down
All my white friends call me talkin' proper now
I got the BET's just so I'm hoppin' out (Yeah)

[JID:]
He without sin cast the first stone
Told my nigga with the gun he can run in your home
One dome shot, niggas'll never look at him wrong again
Oh my God, oh my God, on this lick
In the car twisted, come here, lil' bitch
Suck on my dick, some of the fun under your sister
Come, come, give me some, tongue, tongue, get it done
Young fun, yum, yum, yum, I'm twisted

Get my gun, we 'bout to rob a Wells Fargo
(Whatever I said, I don't know what I said, I don't give a fuck, ah)
Guns and broads, we need to get a whole carload
(You gettin' this? You recording this?)
With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
(Are you getting this?)
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos

[Johnny Venus:]
Yo, vulture just fall in the money
It's calling, I'm callin' forever and ever to you
Taking the boxes of chocolate
I'll send 'em out, ship 'em out, get 'em delivered to you
Baby, whatever, just come on, just hop in and get in the car and we go and get boof
Stragglers is off and they fallin', whatever, just tell 'em to tell 'em better not make a move

[Guapdad 4000:]
Hey, skrrt skrrt in a new thing
Throw the cash and she gettin' Raekwon like the Wu-Tang
I think I deserve me a Mulsanne
Me, you, and two or three hoes should do the group thing
Just don't fuck up the sheets, the airbnb, and fuck off the lease
Bitch, mind your bees, I need peace of mind
I beat meat, delete, then be leavin' fine, let's go

Get my gun, we 'bout to rob a Wells Fargo
Got some broads, we need to get a whole carload
With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos

Nigga, it's just how you count it
It just depend on how you count it
