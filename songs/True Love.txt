[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend to get a piece of this American dream
It seems itâs sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend to get a piece of this American dream
It seems itâs sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[Verse 1]
Yo, Tasha, a fox but, been round the block cause niggas jock her
The wannabe model she dating mobsters
Been involved with street kids to kingpins
Got a thing for the bad boys
That's how she meets him, see him is cat named black
Real name Jack James, stacks change
Real big in the crack game
Sheâs seen that Range and sheâs seen that chain
The bling made the dame wanna give up her last name
She was wit, but he was pimp like, just like Ike was
Treated her like it was the Fight Club
Hit her with rights, blood drippinâ on white rug
By the end of the night, they would kiss and she was iced up
Long as he kept her iced up, she piped down
Hit her off with a little pipe to mic bounce
Down south where a nigga wouldnât return for days or weeks
She was too afraid to cheat
So you ain't even gotta ask
As long as she got a Prada bag
Or an Armani exchange skirt showing a lot of ass
Sheâs good, living the life, sheâs ballinâ
too bad she picked the wrong nigga to get involved with
See the nigga black had problems and enemies
And snake niggas is friends only pretend to be
And cats is out for his head, he caught in some shit
Just watch how Tasha gets tossed in the mix

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now Black owed money and when it comes to this money, trust me
You canât tip toe with nobody cause niggas will do insane things to get they cream
Wonât even speak, let the bullets explain things
That's how it is, paybacks a bitch right especially if you didnât pay back
Niggas is sick like, run up in your crib like âbitch whereâs the bread at?â
âYou got a week to get it, don't got it, youâll regret itâ
Funny I said it cause Jackâs in the same exact predicament
Got a foot in the grave and still digging it
Owe some niggas money with no intentions of giving it
Them niggas is sending warnings, he isnât listening
Tomorrow morning they buss in his front door
And a swarm of muthafuckers with guns drawn coming at
On the hunt for Black, Tasha gets smacked
But Jackâs gone a whole week before he gets back but
Niggas is through waiting, they been too patient already
They ain't recieved a fucking penny
So they called a nigga up
Told him if he doesn't get the dough
And give it up n the next 6 hours, his bitch is fucked
But, hold up!
The nigga Black answers with âSo What!â
âI gives a fuck, shoot the hoe up, still wonât show upâ
Hung the phone up, toss it back and she knew
Sorry baby girl, this is what chedder can do!
