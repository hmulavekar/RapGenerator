Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause, girl, I can't be your man.
No, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You're probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?
Well, then...

Let me see you get high and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range.
I knew her when I rock big old chains.
Now the little nigga doing big old things.

Would you look at that? I came back for it
Just to give it to you like you aksed for it.
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for it.
It rebounds, so, I caught off the backboard.

I told her, "Baby girl, come here.
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.
And I brag hardly,
but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year.
that's unfair."

but so is life: take a chance, roll a dice.
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's over-priced.
Don't over-think, just hope it's right.
I'm only here for the night.

Hottest nigga on the block. Damn, girl, you're mean.
They be starting shit, but it's your world.
On my Martin shit you go, girl.

She bad and she know it. Some niggas save hoes.
I'm not that heroic.
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two-door Fords.
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more.

Cole World, real Cole World.
Them boys cool. Me. I'm on fire.
Know what's on my mind.
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight.

Move slow 'cause you wanna live fast.
Up late, so, you'll probably skip class.
Life is a test.
so before the night pass
get right get right.

Straight up. Now tell me do you really wanna love me foreverâ
Oh, oh, ohâ
