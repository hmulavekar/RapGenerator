Raised me like the father I ain't never had, Iâm still your child
And though Iâve grown in ways that you never known
I ventured into the world, I moved out all on my own
Iâm doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
See shit you wouldnât believe, I write âem down in these poems
And put âem out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me, I hope the shit isnât true
Man look at this shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain't no trappinâ nigga itâs true
Yet they play me on repeat cause I rap for them niggas too
They see I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view

Visions of home, Visions of home
Visions of home, Visions of home (Yeah)
Visions of home, this is my zone

This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This is for my cousin Ricky, damn niggas its been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slanginâ but to each his own
Gotta feed yoâself, smoke a little weed just to ease yoâself
Fuck the whole world I donât need your help
Youâre the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
âMemba that, you remember that?
If you donât, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But Iâm still where the trouble at
Where the trouble at?
Thats cause my flows there
What it look like if I donât go there
Iâm dead wrong, itâs been way too long (long)
My folks there, what it look like if I donât go there?
Iâm dead wrong, itâs been way too long

Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home nigga, visions of home
Iâm coming home, coming home
Yeah Cole World
You know what it isâ¦
