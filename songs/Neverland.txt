[Chorus]
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothing but time
One day youâre gonna set me free
But first you gotta let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look momma Iâm flyinâ

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
Iâll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, noo, Iâll never never land

[Verse 1]
Check my fortune cookie, its that Cole World
Could that mean itâs meant to be?
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur
This life is fucking with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me
My bad girl sayinâ fuck all that, enter me
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them muthafuckas sign off
I got the on my dick theyâll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)
I donât know whats worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Iâm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever
I gotta make it to the top, itâs either now or never
These other niggas canât adapt because they not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt its better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And, so sick they canât fix this with medi-cine
We at yo door and she gotta let us in
Itâs what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now Iâm what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as Iâm speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like Iâm the underdog, Iâm on already
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, yaâll already already

[Chorus]
