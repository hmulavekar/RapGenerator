[Verse 1]
Yea, yea, yea,
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know ya just doing your job, donât mean to disrespect ya
But weâve been going through this thang since way back
I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems babayy...yea, if you only knew
I got bigger problems babbayyy
So why ya talkin about the money that I owe, like as if I didnât know man,
it donât mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying, and my grandmother dying,
could you please stop fuckin with me?
Listen here, I aint lookin for no tears, but my brother got a year,
and my momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, Iâm broke, please put that in your notes
for the next one to call me up talking that shit

[B.o.B]
So life donât pass me by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by
So life donât pass me by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dear Mr. Policeman
Hey am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pullin over me foâ?
Is it this black Mercedez? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause Iâm black? Hmmm, maybe
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatinâ and I hold my breath everytime that you get behind me
I turn my music down, so you wonât hear a sound, man Iâm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, its a trip, every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin college degree

[B.o.B]
So life donât pass me by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by

[Verse 3]
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, âImpossibleâ, but Iâmma fuckin try
Plus how he gonâ tell me, he don't make the rules
Thereâs niggas dying everyday, but we donât make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods âbe fuckin all these white hoesâ
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[B.o.B]
So life donât pass me by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by
Cause sometimes itâll leave you stuck donât ask me why
Gotta keep this trailer moving, no time to cry cry
So lonely days I say goodbye bye
Gotta live for today so life wonât pass me by by
