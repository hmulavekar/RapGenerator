[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
âEy to you it donât matter cause you still gonâ ride with me
Youâre still gonâ ride witâ me
I say youâre still gonâ ride witâ me
I know youâre still gonâ ride witâ me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a, nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out Iâm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, Iâm fly, Iâm a right brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that couldnât ever worry âbout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorised her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, Iâm coming to arrest her
Yah, yâall you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah donât be a parr man, that nigga was a dog
So itâs me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do they make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
âEy Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
âEy to you it donât matter cause you still gonâ ride witâ me
Youâre still gonâ ride witâ me
I say youâre still gonâ ride with me
I know youâre still gonâ ride with me, hey
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gonâ do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
âEy maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now itâs time to hit the real World filled with all them rÃ©sumÃ©s and applications
Man, but ainât nobody calling you back
You say itâs cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the World on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
âEy has this World got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had to break on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, itâs just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ainât changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you youâll get the same me

[Hook]

âEy baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
âEy to you it donât matter cause you still gonâ ride with me
Youâre still gonâ ride with me
I say youâre still gonâ ride with me
I know youâre still gonâ ride with me, hey
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gonâ do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
âEy maybe we can live

Just like a star thatâs in my sky
Just like an Angel on my pain
You have appeared to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and itâs been, way too long
Canât find the words to write this song
Hey, Ugh, still I wanna worry
But it ainât what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goinâ out my mind
Man

[Hook]

âEy baby girl, roll down the window

Even if te money been slow
âEy to you it donât matter cause you still gonâ ride witâ me
Youâre still gonâ ride witâ me
I say youâre still gonâ ride witâ me

Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
